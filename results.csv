Not sure who was more lost  the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out  ,0,1.6816694527005022e-56,1.8523612054988481e-54
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed  became even more ridiculous  as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent  ,1,5.4047418336201016e-83,2.9952296807083497e-83
Very little music or anything to speak of  ,1,2.0801427197083334e-27,1.5981510508672215e-27
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  ,0,2.3827589496108005e-64,5.1386696565347835e-64

It's PURE BRILLIANCE  ,1,4.975194489193156e-15,2.0218500052364065e-15
This was a flick doomed from its conception  ,0,6.34356818866736e-28,1.293387729256409e-27
The very idea of it was lame  take a minor character from a mediocre PG13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a PGrated family movie  ,0,5.9790011750922726e-86,4.1212438279584795e-85
I wasn't the least bit interested  ,0,5.469525041332091e-22,4.340939770809966e-20
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  ,0,2.235211478218764e-101,3.1764435348437765e-99
But it's just not funny  ,0,1.4520961919646282e-19,8.964720470396038e-19
But even the talented Carrell can't save this  ,0,1.0201899585105765e-28,2.4368540704164477e-28
His costars don't fare much better with people like Morgan Freeman Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just wasted  ,0,5.585842177903159e-63,1.1141130487561905e-61
The story itself is just predictable and lazy  ,1,2.0028994135680742e-26,3.207837754735961e-27
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work I've ever seen  ,0,1.826662419980635e-75,2.229370355938582e-74
But whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure  ,0,9.33388802993215e-51,8.01953857109344e-48
The film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  ,0,6.085695201446597e-43,1.1807513286552911e-42
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have  ,0,5.063111793204844e-51,2.3004511523058225e-50

On the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  ,0,2.1678969678860297e-62,4.542782380713601e-61
Long whiny and pointless  ,1,3.871265209214074e-17,3.517393694676738e-17
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go  ,0,5.174916757663231e-40,9.653577061871022e-38

I sat riveted to the TV screen  ,1,6.267265325384969e-24,6.0872150516322796e-24

The performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  ,1,8.177598603680281e-88,3.4852989426303486e-88
And quite honestly often its not very good  ,0,2.279605372710555e-28,3.5549493426347367e-28

It crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy  but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly  ,0,9.02471480635093e-68,7.18566357609377e-67
There are some generally great things in it  ,1,4.6018964757522903e-26,1.2103456314032714e-27

The suspense builders were good & just cross the line from G to PG  ,1,2.2491523497318896e-44,3.421040153808489e-45
I especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents; in other movies I could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections  ,1,3.8670223036016484e-70,1.100998543391575e-70

This is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  ,1,1.605730696908196e-181,1.6034029220566653e-183
